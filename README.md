Disclaimer
----------

Should work on Windows Vista and up, but only tested with Windows 8.1 and
Windows 7. These scripts were written for personal use and released with the
hope that they would be useful, but they haven't been tested with many
different system configurations (yet,) so use them at your own risk.
